# :flower_playing_cards:  React Memory Game

This is a memory game created with React, TypeScript and Styled Components.

## :heart: Motivation

**1. Learn TypeScript**

I've never used TypeScript before in any of my projects projects but i think that is the best thing that should do, especially because TypeScript is getting bigger everyday and the JavaScript comunity is using in every single project. Since i want to contribute more with the comunity i need to learn the tool that they're using.

Anther fact is that in the *React Native 0.62* the PropTypes API will be removed and TypeScript will be the best choice to replace it.

**2. Learn more about CSS animations**

I want to create some nice animations with CSS but i'm not familiar with that, so in this project i will try to create effects without use any third party libraries (such as animate.css).
